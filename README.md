# The Bucket

"The Bucket" is a collection of useful tools, ranging from general to specialized, that don't quite belong in thier own specialized "toolbox" (or at least, not yet).

The name is inspired by the tool bucket im my garage that contains anything from the ubiquitous screwdriver to the pop rivet tool I have used exactly twice. While I have a nice tool chest and several specialized tool boxes, about 90% of my handyman duties call for the use of only a few tools.
